            Up until this point, this car has been fantastic to work on. It has
            had many problems, but were all generally fixable. However, it
            baffles me that so many car manufacturers refuse to make alternator
            replacements as simple a task as they are. Even so, I am grateful
            that it led to this project, which has been on my bucket list for a
            while now.

          <p>
            This project car is going strong at over 350,000 km. Unfortunately,
            after accidentally rolling through one of the largest puddles I had
            ever encountered, the alternator was pooched (an official
            diagnosis). Seeing the battery light come on in the dashboard and
            smelling the strong odor of burning wiring, I knew this repair
            couldn't be procrastinated.

          <h2 className="mb-4 text-xl font-bold">Step 1: Verify the problem</h2>
          <p>
            Before diving into a repair it's always a good idea to verify the
            diagnosis. I used a multimeter to check the voltage at the battery
            terminals with the engine off. No problems here, the battery was
            holding a steady 12.05V. But when I started the engine, the voltage
            dropped to 11.79V. Much lower than the 13.5V to 14.5V the alternator
            should be producing. This confirms that the alternator was
            struggling to power the car and charge the battery properly.
          </p>

            Step 2: Taking out the alternator
          </h2>
          <p>
            Analyzing the alternator gave me a quick understanding of which
            bolts and connections to remove from the old one currently in the
            car. The alternator is held in place by the belt pulley, a mounting
            (pivot) bolt, a tensioner bolt, the primary electrical output
            connection and a smaller ground connection. I started by removing
            the belt pulley, then the tensioner bolt, then the mounting bolt,
            and finally the electrical connections.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>Problem:</strong> Once it was removed, it became very clear
            that I had underestimated the difficulty of this repair. The
            alternator was too large to fit through any gap in the engine bay
            which left me with 2 options. Either I take out my entire air intake
            system which includes disconnecting the carborator (yikes) to bring
            it up out of the engine bay, or I remove the front passenger side CV
            axle to create a gap large enough to remove the alternator from
            below. I chose the latter.

            Since it's an older car I decided I might as well replace both CV
            axles entirely. This was a really smart move because the passenger
            side axle fell apart with almost no effort. The bearings were free
            and grease was everywhere. Partly my fault for not being careful
            enough.

            Step 5.1: Transmission Removal

          <p>
            At this point, the transmission was half way from being ready to be
            removed. Both axles were out and all the fluid was on the driveway.
            I was having issues shifting easily between gears, so I decided this
            would be the best opprotunity to take the transmission out and
            rebuild it.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>Problem:</strong> The transmission was extremely heavy and I
            didn't have a transmission jack. I ended up having to use a floor
            jack with a piece of wood on top to support the transmission. It was
            a sketchy process, but I managed to get it out without dropping it.

          <p>
            However, the day my bud came to help with this process it rained,
            because of course it did. I didn't have access to the garage at the
            time, so we had to improvise on the driveway.

            Step 7: Transmission Teardown Part 2
          </h2>
          <p>
            The next step was to remove 5th gear. For whatever reason, the 5th
            gear lives in its own little housing on the outside of the
            transmission case. Because of this, anyone with this transmission
            should be aware that any minor transmission leaks can become a very
            serious problem and will likely starve 5th gear of oil. However in
            the case of repairing, this is very convenient, so it was a simple
            matter of removing a few bolts and sliding the gear out.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>Problem:</strong> The 5th gear was chipped from previous
            grinding when shifting. This was a really fun surprise...
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Solution:</strong> Do nothing. It is a minor chip and not
            worth the effort to replace this hard to find part.

          </h2>
          <p>
            This was surprisingly difficult and I struggled to get it out. I
            tried carefully prying it with a flat head screw driver but this
            started to dent the maluable aluminum case. I then tried yanking it
            out with rope but in hindsight this was terrible idea and almost
            broke my back. I was desperate enough to try and use floss/string to
            pry it out. I tried for days with varying methods but was
            unsuccessful and eventually opted to take it to a shop. However, no
            shops around would even take it in and I was forced to take it to a
            powertrain shop who usually doesn't work with transmissions in
            general. They are truly my heros and had it cracked in half an hour.

            Step 10: Rebuilding the Transmission
          </h2>
          <p>
            Rebuilding the transmission was a LOT harder than tearing it down.
            On multiple occasions I had put the synchros in the wrong
            orientation or messed up the fragile linkages. By the end of it I
            had dismantled and reassembled the transmission 3 times, testing the
            shifting by hand to make sure everything worked properly. I wont
            show the images here, it just looks the same as dissassembly in
            reverse, but with gallons of brake cleaner.
          </p>
          <p>
            I replaced as much as I could but some of the bearings were really
            trapped in there and since they were still in great condition I
            opted to leave them alone and avoid damaging the aluminum case.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The last thing to do was clean the mating surface between the main
            case and bell housing with soft sandpaper to remove the old crusty
            gasket pieces (this was done during disassembling). Then install the
            new gasket with a thin layer of Black RTV to ensure a good seal.
          </p>
