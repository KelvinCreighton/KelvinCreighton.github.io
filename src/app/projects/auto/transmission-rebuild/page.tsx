            Up until this point, this car has been fantastic to work on. It has had many problems, but were all generally fixable. However, it baffles me that so many car manufacturers refuse to make alternator replacements as simple a task as they are. Even so, I am grateful that it led to this project, which has been on my car repair bucket list for a while now.

          <p>
            This project car is going strong at over 350,000 km. Unfortunately, after accidentally rolling through one of the largest puddles I had ever encountered, the alternator was pooched (an official diagnosis). Seeing the battery light come on in the dashboard and smelling the strong odor of burning wiring, I knew this repair couldn't be procrastinated.

          <h2 className="mb-4 text-xl font-bold">Step 1: Verify the problem</h2>
          <p>
            Before diving into a repair it's always a good idea to verify the diagnosis. I used a multimeter to check the voltage at the battery terminals with the engine off. No problems here, the battery was holding a steady 12.05V. But when I started the engine, the voltage dropped to 11.79V. Much lower than the 13.5V to 14.5V the alternator should be producing. This confirms that the alternator was struggling to power the car and charge the battery properly.
          </p>

          <h2 className="mb-4 text-xl font-bold">Step 2: Taking out the alternator</h2>
          <p>
            Analyzing the alternator gave me a quick understanding of which bolts and connections to remove from the old one currently in the car. The alternator is held in place by the belt pulley, a mounting (pivot) bolt, a tensioner bolt, the primary electrical output connection and a smaller ground connection. I started by removing the belt pulley, then the tensioner bolt, then the mounting bolt, and finally the electrical connections.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>Problem:</strong> Once it was removed, it became very clear that I had underestimated the difficulty of this repair. The alternator was too large to fit through any gap in the engine bay which left me with 2 options. Either I take out my entire air intake system which includes disconnecting the carborator (yikes) to bring it up out of the engine bay, or I remove the front passenger side CV axle to create a gap large enough to remove the alternator from below. I chose the latter.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since it's an older car I decided I might as well replace both CV axles entirely. This was a really smart move because the passenger side axle fell apart with almost no effort. The bearings were free and grease was everywhere. Partly my fault for not being careful enough.

          <p>
            The driver side CV axle was a different story. Instead of being an easy slide out, I had to remove the ENTIRE suspension assembly.

          <h2 className="mb-4 text-xl font-bold">Step 5.1: Transmission Removal</h2>
          <p>
            At this point, the transmission was half way from being ready to be removed. Both axles were out and all the fluid was on the driveway. I was having issues shifting easily between gears, so I decided this would be the best opprotunity to take the transmission out and rebuild it.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>Problem:</strong> The transmission was extremely heavy and I didn't have a transmission jack. I ended up having to use a floor jack with a piece of wood on top to support the transmission. It was a sketchy process, but I managed to get it out without dropping it.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            However, the day my bud came to help with this process it rained, because of course it did. I didn't have access to the garage at the time, so we had to improvise on the driveway.
          </p>

          <p>
            Trying to remove the transmission in the rain was a complete disaster and didn't really go anywhere. Don't do this.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            To remove the transmission, I had to also remove the starter so although I dont have the photos for that, I decided to replace it too.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            After a lot of struggle and many missed connections we finally got it free.

          <h2 className="mb-4 text-xl font-bold">Step 6: Transmission Teardown</h2>
          <p>
            30 years of grease and dirt build up. The initial teardown process required many hours of just scrapping clumps of grease from the main case and bell housing.

          <p>
            After reassembling everything, bleeding the cooling system, and crossing my fingers, the car started right up. The idle was smooth, and knowing the timing belt is fresh provides immense peace of mind. The total job took roughly 8 hours over the weekend.
